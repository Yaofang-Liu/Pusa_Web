A cinematic, hyper-realistic video shot on 35mm film.A hyper-realistic, cinematic image of a massive brutalist spacecraft floating in deep space, its architecture defined by immense, angular structures made of textured concrete-like alloys—etched with vents, alien markings, and massive girders. The ship’s design is cold, monumental, and severe, embodying the aesthetics of space brutalism on a scale that dwarfs nearby celestial bodies. One colossal section of the ship’s hull is made of transparent material, revealing the surreal sight inside: an expansive, vibrant amusement park glowing with neon colors and artificial daylight. From this outer view, roller coasters twist through the internal sky, Ferris wheels spin gently, and colorful lights flash across floating carousels. Tiny human figures with transparent astronaut helmets can be seen wandering through the park, riding attractions, and eating strange alien treats. The contrast between the rigid, imposing exterior and the joyful, dynamic interior creates a surreal juxtaposition—a utopia of leisure suspended within a brutal machine. In the background, a distant planet looms, and stars scatter across the void. The camera hovers far enough to take in the immensity of the ship, but close enough to clearly peer through the transparent wall, like looking into a glowing snow globe hidden in the void.
