Isometric macro shot of a polished ice cream machine set, its nozzle clean and chrome, softly lit from behind. In slow, deliberate motion, the machine clowly begins to extrude an alive, fully formed transparent frog—its gelatinous skin revealing vivid internal organs in pastel colors. Captured at 100FPS in real-footage macro detail, the frog’s limbs unfold naturally as it emerges, its heart visibly pulsating and lungs gently inflating beneath its translucent chest. The lighting is cinematic and backlit, casting refracted glows through its body onto the mint-toned machine surface.
