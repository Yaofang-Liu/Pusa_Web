A highly stylized and exaggerated 3D cartoon character dancing mid-floss. He has ultra-long spaghetti arms, tiny legs with massive mismatched sneakers, and a huge grinning mouth with glowing braces. His oversized eyeballs bulge out comically, and he wears a backward holographic cap, a neon green mesh tank top, and rolled-up camo shorts with pink and teal patches. Playful accessories include slap bracelets, fingerless gloves, and joke tattoos like “LOL” and “404 Error.” The style is colorful, toy-like, and glossy, inspired by vinyl art toys and comedy cartoons. The background is a flat hot pink. Rendered in high-resolution with bold colors and a plastic shine finish. Comedy pop surrealism vibe.
