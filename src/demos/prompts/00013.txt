low-angle shot of a super chaotic, huge, massive static ball of double bass, cellos and tubas, precariously stacked inside an abandoned factory. The double bass, cellos and tubas are positioned upright, sideways, diagonally, and tilted at improbable angles. The image has a photorealistic 35mm film look and realistic shadows, emphasizing the precarious nature of the structure. The dull lights of the theater stage cast a melancholic tone over the scene. The empty factory surrounding the double bass and tubas ball accentuates the absurdity and surreal nature of the image.
