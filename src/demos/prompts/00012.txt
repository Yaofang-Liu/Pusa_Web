low-angle shot of a chaotic, huge, massive helix wooden chairs precariously stacked in grassy field, dusk, some clouds The cows, pigs and wheel barrows are positioned upright, sideways, diagonally, and tilted at improbable angles. The image has a photorealistic 35mm film look and realistic shadows, emphasizing the precarious nature of the structure. The dull light cast a melancholic tone over the scene. The vastness of the field surrounding the arch of cows, pigs and wheel barrows accentuates the absurdity and surreal nature of the image.
