Cinematic wide shot of a cluttered Hong Kong repair shop, packed with tools, fans, wires, and machine partsâ€”everything suddenly begins a silent kinetic transformation. The shelves slide and rearrange themselves, tools float and reassemble into new machines, the walls stretch outward into geometric extensions, forming a futuristic architectural shell. Despite the surreal reconfiguration, the owner remains perfectly still in his chair at the center of the chaos, calmly flipping a newspaper as the shop morphs around him. Style: Hyperreal urban surrealism, soft industrial daylight, detailed texture preservation, smooth morph cuts, static human contrast against kinetic mechanical rebirth.
