A high view wide angle shot of two giraffes kissing gently, while the space between their necks, heads, and the trees behind them forms the shape of a heart. They stand face to face in the golden stillness of the African savanna, close enough that their long necks curve inward in mirrored arcs. The taller giraffe, with deep-toned spots, leans toward the smaller, whose softer coat glows in the evening light. As they press their muzzles together in slow, affectionate contact, the curved space between them aligns with the shapes of distant acacia trees, forming a perfect heart in the composition. The breeze stirs the grasses at their feet, and the low sun silhouettes the edges of their joined forms. Their closeness holds still, creating a moment both natural and impossibly precise. Filmed in 16mm film.
