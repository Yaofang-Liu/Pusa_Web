A highly stylized and exaggerated 3D cartoon character dog caught mid-twerk on two legs. With a stretched-out sausage body, stubby limbs, and enormous cartoon eyes, he wears a shiny silver tracksuit with baby blue and neon green stripes. His mouth is open in a wild, human-like smile, tongue lolling, with sparkly white teeth. He sports a sideways cap with a paw-print, massive sneakers on all four paws, and a gold chain collar. His body is covered in tattoos like “Bone Life,” “Woof Boyz,” and “Squirrel Hunter.” The style is colorful, toy-like, and glossy, inspired by vinyl art toys and comedy cartoons. The background is a flat bright orange. Rendered in high-resolution with bold colors and a plastic shine finish. Comedy pop surrealism vibe. Camera orbits around
