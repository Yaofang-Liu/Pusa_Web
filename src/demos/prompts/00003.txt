A continuous wide-angle action shot captures a first-person chase down a closed mountain road as we follow a woman longboarding at high speed. She tucks into a deep carve, leading us around tight bends and down hairpin curves. Pines blur past, the asphalt vibrating beneath us. Cliffs edge the outer lane, and the descent is relentless. She gains speed, graceful and precise, cutting across golden light. The road is emptyâ€”just her, the board, and the slope.
