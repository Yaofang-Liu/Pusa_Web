A cinematic, hyper-realistic video shot on 35mm film. A hyper-realistic, cinematic image set on the surface of the Moon, where a massive transparent dome structure—resembling a futuristic bubble building—rises from the grey, cratered lunar terrain. Extending from the dome are several sealed, tubular walkways made of reinforced glass and metal, connecting the main structure to smaller outposts and transport hubs scattered across the lunar surface. Inside the dome, a fully artificial beach unfolds: fine white sand, shimmering turquoise water, and sunbathing tourists lounging under umbrellas. The interior is bathed in simulated daylight, with soft golden light mimicking a warm Earth-like sun. Some people swim, others sip cocktails, while children build sandcastles near the water’s edge. Outside, the stark, silent expanse of the Moon stretches infinitely, with Earth suspended in the sky like a fragile blue marble. The juxtaposition between the barren, inhospitable lunar environment and the engineered paradise inside the dome evokes a surreal, otherworldly vision of human leisure in isolation. Wide high angle.
