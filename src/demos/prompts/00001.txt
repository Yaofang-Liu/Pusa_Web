Cinematic wide still shot from the inside of a moving subway, looking out through the window passing a surreal giant Namibian ovambo mask running in a scorched desert terrain enveloped in deep, bright orange haze. Style: Arthouse film-inspired minimalism with surreal juxtapositions, intense monochrome orange lighting from sandstorm ambience, stark silhouettes and vivid costume contrast, blending tradition and symbolism in a hauntingly still and dreamlike atmosphere.
