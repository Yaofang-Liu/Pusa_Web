A continuous first-person wide-angle shot captures us chasing a woman sprinting across city rooftops. She leaps over vents, rails, and skylights with fluid athleticism. The city falls away beside us—streets far below. She clears a rooftop gap ahead and lands perfectly. We follow without pause, camera jostling with each impact. She never looks back. The skyline rolls on as she moves—swift, silent, alone.
