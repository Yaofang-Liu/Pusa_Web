A high-angle shot reveals a massive brutalist concrete building, its form mimicking the word 'BRUTAL'. Stark staircases ascend the facade, connecting cantilevered balconies. Dim ambient lighting casts long shadows, highlighting the rough texture of the concrete. Several people, silhouetted against the sky, stand on the balconies, while others walk along the staircases, their figures emphasizing the scale and coldness of the monolithic structure. The sky is overcast and grey, enhancing the somber mood of the brutalist architecture.
