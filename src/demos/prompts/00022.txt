A high-angle shot in 35mm film, an andalusian white village. Realistic overcast sky lighting, SUDDENLY, the andalusian white village groans and transforms with mechanical precision, like a transformer, unfolding into a walking structure. The realistic transformation is seamless, showcasing the andalusian white village rising onto stoney articulated legs and begins to lumber through the andalusian landscape. The realistic shadows shift and stretch as the walking andalusian white village moves through the andalusian landscape. People in the balconies and windows.
